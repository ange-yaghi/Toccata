# Toccata

*Toccata* is an open-source MIDI analyzer currently under development. *Toccata* doesn't make any promises about making you a better or more creative musician, but it can be very useful for perfecting musical timing, automatically maintaining a record of your musical progress and providing real-time feedback while practicing.

## Features
*Toccata* will be able to:
- Show all metrics and input notes in a fast, responsive GUI
- Recognize individuals bars of music from an imperfect input MIDI stream
- Approximate the input stream's tempo without any human aid
- Provide real-time metrics about pitch, timing and dynamics accuracy
- Catalogue all recorded MIDI data in a database (sorted by music piece) for future reference
- Support thousands of different musical pieces, each with hundreds of bars
